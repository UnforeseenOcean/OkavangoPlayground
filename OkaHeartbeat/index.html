     <h2>Heartbeats and Hippopotami</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="introText" class="graf">
  
  <p>
  I've looked at a lot of my friend Steve's heartbeats over the last couple of months. Steve is the leader of an <a href="http://intotheokavango.org">ambitious expedition</a> I'm part of, setting out to explore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okavango_Delta">Okavango Delta</a>'s catchment from top to bottom. By the time the team on the water pull their boats up into the sands of the Kalahari at the end of August, the river will have taken them over 2,000km and it will have been more than 100 days since their launch in the Angolan highlands.
</p>
<p>
  Along the way they're collecting a lot of data: <a href="http://intotheokavango.org/api/species/viz?expedition=okavango_15">6000 wildlife sightings so far</a>, along with habitat documentation, water and air quality measurements, and interviews with local communities to learn about historical biodiversity changes. They're also collecting data from the expedition members themselves, to document gruelling and often dangerous human experience of being on expedition. So far we've store over two million heartbeats from the team. #Okavango15 is focused both Open Science and Open Story. We want our efforts to add not only to the scientific knowledge about this incredible ecosystem, but to our collective ability to understand it through narrative and storytelling.
</p>
<p>
  The sound you're hearing in the background (double check that your speakers are on) is a sonification of Steve's heartbeat from Saturday, July 11th, at around 10:58am. If you've been reading this at more or less the average speed, in about ten seconds, he's going to be attacked by a hippopotamus. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  
  Wait for it...
  
</p>
<br>
<p>
  All data encode something. In this case, a set of about 600 numbers encode Steve's harrowing experience on the Cuito River:

  <blockquote><em>
  <p>
  "The front tusks pierced the hull near my left foot and flipped the mokoro over in a single push. Capsized, we were now both in the water on top of the hippo. My first thought was get my legs out of the water. I met Giles on top of the overturned hull. I hear my brother, Chris, shout.
  </p>
  <p>
  "Swim!!"
  </p>
  </p>
  We instantly slip into the water and make for the bank, frantically swimming like no one taught us how. I have never stressed, raced and imagined so much. Seconds of frenzy that I will never forget. We were convinced the follow-up rush and bite was coming. Giles touches my leg and my heart stops beating. The current was taking us and the bank seems further away. Suddenly it was there. Slippery and steep."
  <p>
  </em>
  </blockquote>

  The graph below visualizes all of Steve's heartbeats from June 21st: 35 thousand of them. If you click and drag on it to select the bright pink stripe of data that we just heard, beside the white line, you'll be able to see this urgent sequence more closely. You'll also be able to move your mouse to compare the sound of the peak heart rate (169bpm) with some of the calmer moments before and after. Go ahead and do it.

    Click once anywhere on the graph to zoom back out. The graph can show us a lot about that day: the duration, the pattern of activity, the maxima and minima. Graphs are good at this kind of thing. But what graphs aren't very good at is narrative. Or empathy. </p>

    <p>For a long time when I was starting off with data vizualization I'd describe myself as a storyteller, but mostly this wasn't true. I created a lot of things that <em>held</em> story, but I seldom created things that told them. 

    <p>One of the reasons why traditional data visualization isn't good for storytelling is its dependance on visual media.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
  I love Medium. Not only do I publish a fair number of articles there, I also use it as a word processor whenever I have to write pretty much anything. My intention with this article is not to rip the Medium style, but to suggest how data elements could be added to its already excellent design for reading. 
  </p>
  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <p>
  Visit <a href="http://intotheokavango.org">intotheokavango.org</a> to explore all of the data that has come in from the field since the beginning of the expedition. Also, follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/intotheokavango">Twitter</a> & <a href="http://instagram.com/intotheokavango">Instagram</a> for a curious mix of wildlife and data.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you're specifically interested in heartrate data, here is the API call that this example is using, which returns all of Steven's heart beats from day 68 of the expedition: <a href="http://intotheokavango.org/api/features/?FeatureType=ambit_hr&expeditionDay=68&Member=Steve">http://intotheokavango.org/api/features/?FeatureType=ambit_hr&expeditionDay=68&Member=Steve</a>

  All of the interactive magic here was coded in <a href="p5js.org">p5.js</a>, which is my new favourite thing.
